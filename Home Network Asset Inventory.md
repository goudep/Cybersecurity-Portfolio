Key takeaways:  
- **Devices storing sensitive data (Laptop, Hard Drive, Company Tablet, Smart Doorbell) require strong security controls.**  
- **Smart home devices (Light Bulbs, Thermostat, Nest Hub) pose minimal risk but could be potential entry points for attackers.**  
- **Non-networked devices (Printer, Hard Drive) have lower risk but still require physical security considerations.**  

ðŸš€ **Next Steps:** Ensure that high-risk devices have proper security controls like encryption, multi-factor authentication, and secure network configurations.
